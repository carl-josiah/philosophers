Strategic Plan to Master Philosophers Project
Phase 1: Deep Understanding (Day 1-2)
1.1 Grasp the Core Problem
The Dining Philosophers Problem: Research this classic computer science problem
Real-world analogy: Understand why this matters in concurrent programming
The deadlock scenario: Visualize what happens when all philosophers pick up their left fork simultaneously
Resource contention: Understand how limited resources (forks) create synchronization challenges
1.2 Analyze Project Requirements
Input parameters: Map each argument to its role in simulation timing
Success conditions: When does the simulation end successfully vs failure
Death conditions: Precise timing requirements and detection constraints
Output format: Understand why message ordering and timing matter
Edge cases: Single philosopher, very short timings, immediate death scenarios
1.3 Understand Threading vs Process Models
Mandatory: Why threads + mutexes for this problem
Bonus: Why processes + semaphores as alternative
Trade-offs: Memory sharing vs isolation, performance vs safety
Phase 2: Concept Mastery (Day 2-3)
2.1 Threading Fundamentals
Study concurrency basics: What happens when multiple threads run simultaneously
Understand thread lifecycle: Creation, execution, joining, cleanup
Learn synchronization necessity: Why unsynchronized access fails
Research common pitfalls: Race conditions, deadlocks, starvation
2.2 Mutex Deep Dive
Mutual exclusion concept: Why only one thread can hold a resource
Critical sections: Identifying code that needs protection
Lock ordering: How to prevent deadlocks with multiple mutexes
Performance implications: When locking becomes a bottleneck
2.3 Time Management
Precision requirements: Why usleep isn't enough for precise timing
Timestamp calculation: Converting system time to milliseconds
Simulation timing: How to track eating/sleeping durations accurately
Death detection timing: Meeting the 10ms detection requirement
Phase 3: Problem Analysis (Day 3-4)
3.1 Identify Core Challenges
Deadlock prevention: How to ensure philosophers don't all grab left forks
Starvation avoidance: Ensuring every philosopher gets to eat
Race condition elimination: Protecting all shared state
Performance optimization: Minimizing unnecessary waiting
3.2 Design Constraints Analysis
No global variables: How to share state between threads safely
Memory management: Preventing leaks in threaded environment
Error handling: Graceful cleanup when things go wrong
Message synchronization: Preventing overlapping output
3.3 Architecture Planning
Data structures needed: What information each thread needs
Shared vs private data: What needs mutex protection
Thread responsibilities: What each thread should do
Communication patterns: How threads coordinate
Phase 4: Solution Strategy (Day 4-5)
4.1 Deadlock Prevention Strategies
Research different approaches: Ordered locking, resource hierarchy, timeouts
Choose optimal strategy: Consider philosopher numbering and fork assignment
Plan implementation: How to ensure consistent lock ordering
4.2 State Management Design
Philosopher states: Eating, sleeping, thinking, dead
Shared simulation state: Stop conditions, death flags
Thread-safe operations: All state changes need protection
4.3 Monitoring Strategy
Death detection: How to monitor philosopher health continuously
Simulation termination: Clean shutdown on death or meal completion
Performance monitoring: Avoiding busy-waiting where possible
Phase 5: Implementation Planning (Day 5-6)
5.1 Module Breakdown
Initialization module: Setup philosophers, mutexes, threads
Philosopher routine: Main thread function for each philosopher
Action functions: Eating, sleeping, thinking implementations
Monitoring module: Death detection and simulation control
Utilities: Time functions, printing, cleanup
5.2 Development Order
Basic structure first: Data structures and initialization
Single-threaded logic: Implement actions without threading
Add threading: Create philosopher threads
Add synchronization: Implement mutex protection
Add monitoring: Death detection and termination
Optimization: Timing precision and performance
5.3 Testing Strategy
Unit testing: Test each module independently
Integration testing: Test thread interactions
Edge case testing: Single philosopher, timing edge cases
Stress testing: Many philosophers, long simulations
Race condition testing: Use tools to detect synchronization issues
Phase 6: Quality Assurance (Day 6-7)
6.1 Code Review Checklist
Thread safety: Every shared variable protected
Memory management: No leaks, proper cleanup
Error handling: Graceful failure modes
Code organization: Clear separation of concerns
6.2 Performance Verification
Timing accuracy: Verify eat/sleep durations
Death detection: Confirm 10ms requirement
Resource efficiency: Minimize CPU usage during waiting
Scalability: Test with many philosophers
6.3 Norm and Requirements
42 Norm compliance: Coding standard adherence
Function limitations: Proper use of allowed functions only
Makefile correctness: All required rules implemented
Directory structure: Files in correct locations
