1. what is philosophers all about?
— the philosophers project is all about concurrent programming.
— concurrent programming is a type of programming where there are several
threads or processes running simultaneously.
— processes are running programs in your computer and threads act as mini
processes that run inside your processes. think of threads as a smaller version
of the process.
— the philosophers project is all about concurrently programming philosophers who eat,
think, and sleep. the main goal is to avoid them from starving. they all sit in a circular
table and in between each philosopher lies a fork. each philosopher only gets to eat when 
they pick up two forks.

2. what is the main problem?
— the main problem is about dealing with coordination, synchronization, and timing issues that
comes with concurrent programming. concurrency has a trade-off, an increase in performance, but has
a higher potential to slow down, or halt progress.
