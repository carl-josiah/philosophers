1. Consistent Fork Locking Order
Always lock the lower-indexed fork first for every philosopher.
This prevents deadlock and helps avoid starvation.

Example:

Do the reverse order for unlocking.

(1. is already done.)

2. Responsive Custom Sleep
Never use plain usleep for eating/sleeping/thinking.
Instead, use a custom sleep function that:

Sleeps in small increments (e.g., 500us)
Checks for simulation end or death between increments
Example:

Use this everywhere you would have used usleep.

3. Meal Time Update
Update last_meal_time immediately after acquiring both forks and before eating.

Protect this update with a mutex if needed.
Do not update after eating or after releasing forks.
Example:

4. Monitor Thread
Monitor each philosopher’s last meal time in a loop:

Lock the meal time mutex before reading.
If now - last_meal_time > time_to_die, set the death flag and end the simulation.
Sleep for a small interval (e.g., 1–2ms) between checks.
Example:

5. No Extra Delays or Staggering
Do not add extra usleep or custom_usleep after sleeping or thinking.
Only stagger at the very start if you want, but it’s not required if your code is responsive.
6. Thread-Safe Printing
Protect all printing with a mutex to avoid garbled output.
7. Clean Shutdown
When a philosopher dies, set a shared flag (protected by a mutex).
All threads should check this flag and exit their routines if it is set.
8. Edge Cases
Handle the single philosopher case (only one fork) so they die after time_to_die.

If you want to pass like hajiraphilo:
You do NOT need a semaphore or waiter.
You DO need:

Consistent fork order
Responsive custom sleep
Timely meal time updates
Reasonable monitor interval
If you want, I can write you a template for each of these functions in your style.
Let me know which part you want to see first!

can you put everything i have to do in a txt format

Certainly! Here is a step-by-step checklist in plain text format, based on hajiraphilo’s approach and what you need for your own project to reliably pass the tight timing test:

PHILOSOPHERS PROJECT: "NO STARVATION" CHECKLIST

Consistent Fork Locking Order
Always lock the lower-indexed fork first, then the higher one.
Example:
Unlock in the reverse order.
Responsive Custom Sleep
Never use plain usleep for eating/sleeping/thinking.
Use a custom sleep function that:
Sleeps in small increments (e.g., 500us).
Checks for simulation end/death between increments.
Example:
Meal Time Update
Update last_meal_time immediately after acquiring both forks and before eating.
Protect with a mutex if needed.
Example:
Monitor Thread
In a loop, for each philosopher:
Lock the meal time mutex, check if now - last_meal_time > time_to_die.
If so, set the death flag and end the simulation.
Sleep for a small interval (e.g., 1–2ms) between checks.
Example:
No Extra Delays or Staggering
Do not add extra usleep or custom sleep after sleeping or thinking.
Only stagger at the very start if you want, but it’s not required.
Thread-Safe Printing
Protect all printing with a mutex to avoid garbled output.
Clean Shutdown
When a philosopher dies, set a shared flag (protected by a mutex).
All threads should check this flag and exit their routines if it is set.
Edge Cases
Handle the single philosopher case (only one fork) so they die after time_to_die.
If you follow all these steps, your program should behave like hajiraphilo and pass the tight timing test without starvation.
