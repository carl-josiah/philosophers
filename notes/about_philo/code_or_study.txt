Where I'd Use Code-First:
Building a web API
Creating a CRUD application
Writing utility scripts
Implementing algorithms
Making games
Data processing

Where I'd Use Study-First:
Writing thread pools
Implementing locks/mutexes
Network protocol implementation
Real-time audio processing
Database transaction systems
Operating system components

The Brutal Truth:
Most programmers (including experienced ones) use code-first for 95% of their work.

The study-first approach is a specialized tool for specialized problems.
