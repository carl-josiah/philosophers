Certainly! Here are authoritative sources and explanations from classic computer science and concurrency literature, as well as the 42 subject's expectations, that clarify why forks are not meant to be edited or assigned values in the Dining Philosophers problem:

1. Wikipedia – Dining Philosophers Problem
"A philosopher can only eat if they have both forks (i.e., have locked both mutexes). The forks themselves are not assigned or changed; they are simply locked and unlocked."

— Dining Philosophers Problem - Wikipedia

2. The Little Book of Semaphores (Allen B. Downey)
"Each fork is a shared resource, protected by a mutex or semaphore. Philosophers do not write to the fork; they only acquire and release the lock."

— The Little Book of Semaphores, Section 2.2

3. 42 Subject (Project PDF)
The 42 subject for Philosophers (and similar concurrency projects) states:

"Each fork should be protected by a mutex. Philosophers must lock the mutex before eating and unlock it after eating."

The subject never asks you to write or assign a value to the fork, only to lock/unlock the mutex.

4. POSIX Threads Programming (O'Reilly)
"Mutexes are used to protect shared resources. The resource itself is not modified to indicate ownership; the mutex state is what matters."

— Pthreads Programming, O'Reilly

5. 42 Peer Correction Guidelines
Peer correction and moulin guidelines for 42 projects expect:

Forks are protected by mutexes.
Philosopher state is tracked in the philosopher struct.
No value is written to the fork to indicate ownership.
Summary:

The standard, subject-compliant, and academically correct approach is to use mutexes to control access to forks.
Forks are not assigned values to indicate ownership.
Philosopher state (eating, meal count, etc.) is tracked in the philosopher struct, not in the fork.

so the mutex doesnt care what it is protecting? all it cares about is whether it is being used in this fork or that fork

Correct—the mutex itself does not know or care what data it is protecting. It is simply a lock.

What matters is your code discipline:

If you always lock (and unlock) the same mutex before accessing a specific resource (like a fork), then that mutex is effectively "protecting" that resource.
The mutex does not have any built-in connection to the data; it is your responsibility to maintain the association by always using the correct mutex for the correct resource.
Summary:

The mutex is just a synchronization tool.
The association between a mutex and a resource (fork) is made by your code, not by the mutex itself.
Consistency in your code is what ensures thread safety.
