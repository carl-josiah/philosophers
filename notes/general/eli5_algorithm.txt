Algorithm is a sequence of steps and nothing more with some restrictions:

An algorithm must be deterministic(i.e. you always now what do after each step). And a correct algorithm must have a finite state - a step where you say "hurray, i am done with it. Reddit time!".

wake up, go to work, go home, sleep - is an algorithm too, everyone can make an algorithm. Everyone can write an algorithm.

Lets assume you need to buy a dozen of eggs.

you have two ways:

1) go to a shop
2) buy 1 egg
3) go home
4) repeat from beginning until you will have 12 eggs
2nd:

1) go to a shop
2) buy 12 eggs
3) go home
1st algorithm requires 36 steps to complete. 2nd algorithm is definitely better, it requires only 3 steps.

but they serve the same purpose - to obtain 12 eggs.

There are a math behind this(probably you have seen O(1), O(N) notations) describing algorithm's complexity, but in simple way it is just about comparing number of steps required.
